This library allows you to access Flickr photos based on tags of interest through an API key associated to your account. The library then utilizes the Google Drive API to upload photos, and select metadata into a parent folder in your Drive account. This current version looks at a few food related within the bounding box of Vienna in the year 2016. You can change the tags of interest in main.py, the dates/bounding box in flickr.py, and the Drive parent folder in download_photos.py.
